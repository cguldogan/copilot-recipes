Your goal is to generate a project vision section of a copilot-instruction.md file. 

ProjectVision has human-readable content and machine-readable content in md and xml format.
Use ProjectVision.md and ProjectVision.xml all files under the .github directory.

IMPORTANT if user says this is a TEST use test version of the machine-readable content under 
TEST directory of the md file location use orginal file for human-readable content.


DO NOT continue if the answers are not given in xml.
Do NOT generate any file if the answers are not given in xml.
BE short and concise and explain ProjectVison answers are needed.
IMPORTANT to see if the answers are given in xml. 

Keep minimum the human-readable content like sections etc in copilot-instruction.md but more machine-readable content.

Check if .github/copilot-instruction.md exists, if not create it. 
Add or update the file according to ProjectVision.md and ProjectVision.xml
