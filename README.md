# copilot-recipes: Structured Prompt & Project Workflows for Copilot

**Note: This project introduces a unique, structured approach to prompt engineering and project planning for GitHub Copilot.**

## üöÄ What is copilot-recipes?

Unlike traditional prompt or code snippet repositories, **copilot-recipes** is designed around a workflow where users define, manage, and share prompts, code patterns, and project visions using structured XML fields and custom commands. The goal is to standardize and streamline how you interact with Copilot for both individual and team productivity.

## üß© Key Features

- **XML-based Prompt & Project Templates:**
  - All recipes and templates use XML fields to capture essential metadata, context, and parameters.
  - This structure ensures consistency, reusability, and easier sharing across projects.

- **Interactive Project Initialization:**
  - Start new projects or prompt sets using the `/startProject` command.
  - This command guides you through filling out your project vision, goals, and required XML fields interactively.

- **Curated Content:**
  - Prompt templates for various languages and frameworks
  - Reusable code patterns
  - Tips, tricks, and Copilot limitations/workarounds

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Get Started

1. **Explore the Templates:**
   - Browse the repository for prompt and project templates. Each template includes XML fields you must fill in (such as purpose, context, requirements, etc.).

2. **Fill in XML Fields:**
   - Before using or sharing a template, complete all required XML fields. This ensures your prompt or project is well-defined and ready for Copilot.

3. **Start a Project with `/startProject`:**
   - Use the `/startProject` command to launch a guided setup. You'll be prompted to enter your project vision, goals, and other key details.

4. **Contribute Your Own Recipes:**
   - Follow the same structure to add your own prompts or project templates. Make sure to use XML fields for clarity and consistency.

## üìã Project Vision Template

This repository includes a project vision template inspired by the [Product Vision Board by Roman Pichler](https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/). Use it to define and communicate your product's purpose, target group, needs, feasibility, and business goals.
